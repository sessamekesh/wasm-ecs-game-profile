The following files are expected by the build system:

defeated.fbx
idle.fbx
run.fbx
walk.fbx
ybot-geo.fbx

As of now, I'm using models that I don't actually have redistribution rights to use!

I'm hoping to comission a model and some art that I can include directly in this repository,
but for now I'm including the processed and bundled asset packs (which I can redistribute)
instead of the raw files.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
